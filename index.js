/*7
* Accessing Values in Arrays

var partyList = ["carrot cake", "rocky road ice cream", "mochiko chicken", "orange tang", "lemon bars"];

What is the length of this array? Please console.log the length only.
What index position is carrot cake? Please console.log this item.
What index position is lemon bars? Please console.log this item.

/*
* #8 
* Concatenation 
* Concatenate the variables `firstName` and `lastName` and store this to a new variable called `fullName`.

* Concatenate the variables `fullName` and `birthPlace` to create the following sentence:
 xx xx is from xx.
 
*Concatenate the variables `mariahCareyAge`, `favSneaker`, `favLoveSong` and `coffeeShop` to create the following sentence:
At the age of xx, Mariah Carey, wearing her fancy xx sang xx at the xx.

/**
* #9 Arithmetic
* Variables with the outcome of an arithmetic operation.
* Declare two variables, `num1` and `num2` and assign each of these variables a number of your choosing.
* Next perform the following arithmetic operations:

* Add the two variables and store it to new variable named sum.
* Subtract the two variables and store it to a new variable named difference.
* Mulitply the two variables and store it to a new variable named product.
* Divide the two variables and store it to a new variable named quotent.
* What is the remainder when you divide num1 by num2?


/**
* #10
* Comparisons & Logic
* Variables with the outcome of a comparison operation:
*
* Declare a variable named isEqual and compare two strings "Tacocat" and "tacocat" using the strict equality.
* Declare another variable named isEqualed and compare the two strings "Tacocat" and "tacocat" using equality.
* Console.log both variables. What are the differences between the two and why?

* Declare a variable named sameNum and compare a string "5" and a number 5 using strict equality.
* Declare another variable named sameNumba and compare a string "5" and a number 5 using equality.
* Console.log both variables. What are the differences between the two and why?

* Use the logical and && and or || and compare the following:
* 3>2 3<1 (use or)
* 3>2 6>3 (use and)
* 7>2 8<5 (use and)
* Declare variables and console.log the results. What are the differences between the three and why?


/**
* #11
* Assignments
* Variables with the outcome of an assignment operation:
*
* Declare a variable named `myBox` and assign it with a number of your choosing.
* This variable will be used to store multiple types of values as we assign them to show how variables in JavaScript are not bound to a single data type
* and can change values.

* Write 5 different assignment statements and `console.log()` the value of the variable after each
* assignment statement to show the current value.
*


/**
* Final Boss 
* Additional exercises designed to further challenge you and give you a jump start on the next topic that'll be covered.
* Function - A block of code designed to perform a particular task. It allows you to reuse code.
*
* Declare a function named bakePie which has a single parameter 'ingredient'.
* When the function is invoked, it should return a string, "Today's special ingredient pie." Where ingredient will be the value that you pass into the function.
* For example, if the value is `blueberry`, it should return "Today's special blueberry pie."
* Declare a variable 'pieResult' and assign it to the function call.
* Console.log the variable to see the result.


* Declare a Function named `jump` which has a single parameter, `height`.
* This function should return a string, "You jumped height feet high!" Where height will be the value that you pass into the function.
* For example, if the value is 9, it should return "You jumped 9 feet high!"
*
* Declare a variable 'jumpResult' and assign it to the function call.
* Console.log the variable to see the result.


* Declare a Function named `cook` which a takes three parameters, `ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, `recipeName`.
* This function should return a String along the lines of, "Tomatoes and Cheese make a Pizza!"
* if invoked in this way -> cook("Tomatoes", "Cheese", "Pizza");
