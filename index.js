/**
* #6
* Variables with an Array value
* 
* Declare a variable named 'plateLunch` and assign it with 5 of your favorite lunch items.

/*7
* Accessing Values in Arrays

var partyList = ["carrot cake", "rocky road ice cream", "mochiko chicken", "orange tang", "lemon bars"];

What is the length of this array? Please console.log the length only.
What index position is carrot cake? Please console.log this item.
What index position is lemon bars? Please console.log this item.

/*
* #8 
* Concatenation 
* Concatenate the variables `firstName` and `lastName` and store this to a new variable called `fullName`.

* Concatenate the variables `fullName` and `birthPlace` to create the following sentence:
 xx xx is from xx.
 
*Concatenate the variables `mariahCareyAge`, `favSneaker`, `favLoveSong` and `coffeeShop` to create the following sentence:
At the age of xx, Mariah Carey, wearing her fancy xx sang xx at the xx.

/**
* #9 Arithmetic
* Variables with the outcome of an arithmetic operation.
* Declare two variables, `num1` and `num2` and assign each of these variables a number of your choosing.
* Next perform the following arithmetic operations:

* Add the two variables and store it to new variable named sum.
* Subtract the two variables and store it to a new variable named difference.
* Mulitply the two variables and store it to a new variable named product.
* Divide the two variables and store it to a new variable named quotent.
* What is the remainder when you divide num1 by num2?


* Declare a variable named `sumOfNumbers` which is a Number. This Number
* contains the result of performing an arithmetic operation on two numbers.
* Have this variable store the result of adding 3 numbers of your choosing.
*
* Extend this behavior to include subtraction, multiplication and division.

/**
* #6b Comparisons & Logic
* Variables with the outcome of a comparison operation:
*
* Declare a variable named `isEqual` which is a Boolean. This Boolean
* contains the result of performing a comparison to test if two strings
* are equal. We want to compare the two strings "Tacocat" and "tacocat" and
* `console.log()` the result.
*
* NOTE:
*   There is no test which tests your console.log()'s output'.
*   Also, there are zero tests for the BONUS below.
*
* BONUS:
*   See if you can come up with a few examples of double comparison
*   operator(==) vs triple comparison operator(===).

/**
* #6c Assignments
* Variables with the outcome of an assignment operation:
*
* Declare a variable named `generalContainer`. This variable will be used to store multiple types of
* values as we assign them to show how variables in JavaScript are not bound to a single data type
* and can change values.
*
* Write 5 different assignment statements and `console.log()` the value of the variable after each
* assignment statement to show the current value.
*
* NOTE:
*   The tests for this section cannot test your variable as it changes,
*   it can only test that you declared the variable by giving it the right name.

/**
* #7a
* Declare Functions
*
* Declare a Function named `jump` which takes a single argument, `height`
*
* This function should return a String, "You jumped 9 feet high!"
* if invoked in this way -> jump(9);
*
* Store the return value to a variable named `jumpResult` and use console.log to inspect the value which was returned by your function

/**
* #7b
* Declare Functions
*
* Declare a Function named `cook` which a takes three arguments/parameters, `ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, `recipeName`
*
* This function should return a String along the lines of, "Tomatoes and Cheese make a Pizza!"
* if invoked in this way -> cook("Tomatoes", "Cheese", "Pizza");
